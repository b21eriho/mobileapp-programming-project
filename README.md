# Report
The app was decided to be usable as a calendar for a fictional world of my own creation. Specifically for one of the world months.
This month has 25 days and notably the amount of daylight goes from 12 hours on the first of the month and on the last and 25th the sun does
not set at all. Thus the app should display the time of sunset and sunrise. Additionally some days have specific names that it is called in
conversation instead of the days date. Further there are events that occur on some days and these should also be displayed in the app.
### Sketch/design
The design of the app was naturally made to fill these decided requirements of the app as well as the given requirements from the task.
The given requirements on the design were, at large, to show multiple pieces of information on every entry in a list of many of any thing.
This thing in this case is naturally a day. Further there should be a type of filter that can be activated to only show some of the entries.
Further there should be a screen that displays information about for who the app is useful. Lastly every list-item should be clickable at which
point a new screen with more information of the said item should be shown.
